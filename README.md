 Explainable AI for Medical Imaging

This repository contains Explainable AI applied to medical image analysis.

The project focuses on:
- Deep learning–based tumor classification
- Explainability using Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++
- Uncertainty estimation using Monte Carlo Dropout
- Automatic AI-generated clinical-style case reports

The main implementation is provided as a Google Colab notebook.
